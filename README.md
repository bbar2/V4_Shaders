# V4_Shaders


Vulkan tutorial project based on Tutorial by Alexandar Overvoorde.

Development environment:

Linux Ubuntu 20.04 focal

CLion 2020.1 IDE with CMake 3.13.4 build system

The wiki pages include notes on areas that did not work per the tutorial (usually due to tool version differences), or things that were unique to the CLion/CMake environment and not covered by the tutorial.
